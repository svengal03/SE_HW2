|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3 |evidence in GH|
|Number of commits| 3 |in GH|
|Number of commits: by different people| 3 |in GH|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|
|Issues are being closed| 2 |evidence in GH|
|DOI badge: exists| 3 |in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |  |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |  | 
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| ||
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| | |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|  | |
